Here are a few tips on how they can safely be used:\r\n*  Ensure your mask is made of at least two layers of tightly woven fabric.\r\n*  Wash your hands or use alcohol-based hand sanitizer before and after touching the mask or face covering.\r\n* Use the ear loops or ties to put on and remove the mask.\r\n*  Make sure your nose and mouth are fully covered.\r\n\r\nWearing a non-medical mask or face covering alone will not prevent the spread of COVID-19.
